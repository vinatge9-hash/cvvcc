# Brew & Beans - Coffee Shop Website

This project consists of a complete, responsive coffee shop website generated from a single-category prompt (Coffee Shop).

What you get:
- 4 production-ready HTML pages (index.html, menu.html, about.html, contact.html)
- Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for all styling
- Category-appropriate typography (placeholders ready for auto-processing, e.g., font-[Montserrat], font-[OpenSans])
- Accessible markup with alt attributes for all images
- Internal navigation across pages
- A README with project details

How to run:
- Simply open the HTML files in a browser.
- To customize, edit text content, images (placeholders), and links as needed.

Notes:
- All colors reflect the Coffee Shop theme: warm coffee tones in primary/secondary/accent colors.
- Background hero images use placeholders: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1753596726281-8fd876febab8?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w3ODkyNDZ8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwzfHwuLi58ZW58MHwwfHx8MTc1OTQyNzU1OXww&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=1080 which will be processed by your site generator.
- Fonts are referenced via Tailwind-safe placeholders (font-[Montserrat], font-[OpenSans]); ensure the font files are loaded via your deployment process.

If you want to extend this site (e.g., add a blog, events page, or order system), tell me and Iâ€™ll incrementally modify the existing files while preserving the design system.
